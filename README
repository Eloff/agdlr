  "agdlr", the Silverlight Dynamic Languages project, is the integration 
  between Silverlight and Dynamic Languages running on the Dynamic Language 
  Runtime (DLR). The languages included in this package are IronRuby, 
  IronPython, and Managed JScript.

  Note: this package is meant to be used to develop applications with 
  Silverlight 2 RTW. To install Silverlight, visit the following:

Package -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  /script:  tools for creating and running Silverlight applications

  /LICENSE: Microsoft Public License

  /README:  This file.

  /samples: See /samples/README for more information

  /src:     Source code for Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll and Chiron.exe.
            See /src/README for more information.

Getting Started ---------------------------------------------------------------

  ===============================================================================
  1. Create a new Silverlight application
  2. Run an application
  ===============================================================================
  
  1. Create a new Silverlight application

    > script/sl [ruby|python|jscript] <application_name>

    This will create a Silverlight application in the language of your choosing in
    the "application_name" directory where you ran the script.

    This command requires Ruby to be installed.
      Windows:  "One-Click Installer" for Ruby: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167
      Mac OS X: Ships with Ruby pre-installed.

  2. Run an application

    > script/server /b

    This will launch Chiron, the Silverlight development utility, as well as open
    your default browser to http://localhost:2060. If you pass the /w
    instead of the /b switch, it will just start the server and not launch your
    browser. See the Chiron section below for more of its usage details.

    Note: Place </path/to>/sdlsdk/script on your PATH to omit the "script/" from
          these commands.
          
    This command requires Mono to be installed on the Mac.

Breaking Changes --------------------------------------------------------------

0.4.0 

  Custom Fonts: In Silverlight 2 Beta 2 a custom font could either be placed 
  in the XAP file, or as an assembly resource, and loaded by Silverlight. 
  In Silverlight 2 RC0, only an assembly resource is allowed. The current 
  work-around for dynamic languages is to load a dummy DLL with the fonts as
  resources.

  JScript/Python Interop: This version breaks JScript/Python interop since
  JScript does not support IDynamicObject, which Python uses to do dynamic 
  method dispatch. Therefore, the sample that showed this, jscript/fractulator,
  is not in this release.
